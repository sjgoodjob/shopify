But, while it may be fun, accessible, and a bold way to spice up your sex life, it can also be uncomfortable and difficult. After all, most people don’t usually stick anything up their anus, and even the ones that do, have to admit that there are some steps that can be taken to make it easier. Unlike vaginas, our anuses do not lubricate themselves when we are aroused. So, if you want anal sex to be as comfortable as vaginal sex, it’s important to remember lubricant.
<br><br><a href="https://www.honeyplaybox.com/collections/lubes/products/water-based-personal-lubricant-2-fl-oz" target="_self"><u> 
Lubricants</u></a> (or “lubes”) are lotions and liquids that have been designed to be safe to insert inside orifices. Without lubrication, anal sex can be dry, rough, and even dangerous, as the dry skin can snag and rip under the right circumstances.
<br><br> 
However, lubricants aren’t the only way to make anal sex easier and more comfortable for beginners. An easy way to make anal sex more accessible is to consider the position that you and your partner will be in during the intercourse.</span></p></div></div></div><div class="sc-iJKOTD qriss pf-22_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-md:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-jHkVzv dZEEUA pf-21_"><h2 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-iAKWXU kOzfyS pf-20_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-kTLmzF bGBrSp pf-19_"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Position #1 Lying Doggy

You may have heard of it in popular culture, jokes, movies, or music, and with good reason. It’s the most famous anal sex position because it’s the easiest. “Lying Doggy” is very similar, except that both partners are lying on a bed, facing down. To accomplish this, the receiving partner must lie down on the bed, with their back facing upward as the thrusting partner lies directly on top of them and enters them from behind. Because the thrusting partner will be lying on top of the receiving partner, it’s important to make sure that the receiving partner is lying comfortably and that there are pillows nearby for added support.

However, some receiving partners may enjoy bouncing up and down to further stimulate both themselves and their partners, so this position also allows for interactivity. This position is also great for people who are uncomfortable maintaining eye contact or facing their partner, as they can get intimate without having to get too emotionally intimate. By not facing each other, this position allows two partners to focus on their own body and their partner’s, and some people love focusing on the physical side of things.</span></p><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-iAKWXU kOzfyS pf-41_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-kTLmzF bGBrSp pf-40_"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Disadvantages:

This pillow will lift their pelvis, giving the thrusting partner a clearer angle of entry and allow them to penetrate deeper. From this position, the thrusting partner can pull on the receiving partner’s hair, grab their throat, or caress or stimulate them in any way they prefer. It’s crucial that the thrusting partner makes sure that the receiving partner is relaxed, loose, and aroused. A good way to make sure that the receiving partner is ready for entry is using toys like <a href="https://www.honeyplaybox.com/collections/anal-beads/products/defy-anal-beads-vibrating-anal-vibrator" target="_self"><u>anal beads</u></a> or <u><a href="https://www.honeyplaybox.com/collections/butt-plugs/products/doro-pretty-vibrating-anal-plug-with-remote-control" target="_self">anal plugs</a> </u>to see how tight they are.

It’s become so popular that it has been modified, adjusted, and reinvented for the pleasures and preferences of the people who enjoy it. The Tilted Doggy is one more variation of the classic Doggy Style. To achieve it, the receiving partner must lie on all fours on a bed or floor and support the weight of their own body. The thrusting partner must lie on their knees on that same floor or bed and enter from behind. This position allows both partners to control the penetration. By lying on all fours, the receiving partner can adjust their position to have a stronger base for penetration, and the thrusting partner can also use their knees as a strong base to thrust their hips and control their upper body.</span></p><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-iAKWXU kOzfyS pf-68_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-kTLmzF bGBrSp pf-67_"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Advantages:

But you’d be wrong. The Full Throttle is a variation of the Missionary Position that really puts the pedal to the metal.
<br><br>It starts off as a Missionary Position, but then the receiving partner raises their legs and folds them down toward their body. The receiving partner’s feet will be on either side of the penetrating partner’s head. From this position, the receiving partner’s anus will be lower than their vagina and their body will be bent up to 120 degrees from the flat surface. This angle will allow the penetrating partner to enter them easily.<br><br>This is a relatively easy position to pull off, but the position is daring enough to drive many couples wild. After all, the position gets its name because the receiving partner puts their legs up like the bars of a motorcycle, letting the penetrating partner go Full Throttle.

</span></span></h3><p class="sc-htJRVC jYbLmW pf-128_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-kTLmzF bGBrSp pf-127_">Because the receiver’s body is almost fully folded, the penetrating partner can enter them deeply, fully, and directly. This is a must-try position for lovers of deep penetration.<br><br>This position also allows both partners to be face to face, which allows them to make eye contact and kiss, which promotes more emotional intimacy.

If the receiving partner has a bad back or chronic pain in their lumbar region, this position is not recommended. Holding this position for too long will also make the receiving partner tired or could make their legs go numb from being up in the air, so be sure to take a break or switch positions if any discomfort arises.<br><br>First timers may find it difficult to relax their body and anus while maintaining the receiving pose, so the thrusting partner should be patient and penetrate slowly until their partner is ready.
